# Ceremonies
----------

Ceremony is a time of celebration, connecting to the ancient wisdom and magic of the land, and remembering our deep connection with the natural world.

The Temple of Éiriú offers ceremonies in restoration of the Sacred relationship between the people and the Land

### Fire Festivals

Fire is what holds people together in community and heart. Fire is a place to come together for warmth and connection, not only the physical level, but also emotionally, mentally and spiritually. We gather in community around the sacred fire, and as we hold our intentions for ourselves and others, we can find our stresses and difficulties transformed.

### Aisling Eala - Swan Dance

The vision of Aisling Éala is to awaken and gather the wisdom that has been left by our ancestors encoded in our stories and in the spirit of the land itself, our beautiful Éiriú. This wisdom can help us navigate the transition time we are now passing through on the earth and guide us to a finer vibrational energy.

### Baby Naming Ceremonies

Here the child is welcomed into life by the family and community. The child is blessed into the elements of fire, earth, water, air and ether to help to anchor them in this life and to bring protection and blessing. It is encouraged that the community bring their best intentions for the child, that will help them grow in strength and love.

### Funerals and Life Honouring Ceremonies

We offer beautiful and personal ceremonies to honour loved ones who have passed. We hold prayers and blessing for their passing from this life in peace, and celebrate and remember the jewels of their life. Ceremonies can be tailored to the wishes of people and their families.

### Home Cleansing & Blessing

This service is offered so that your home can truly become a place of sanctuary, where you can rest and rejuvenate. We can clean our houses physically, but there is also the need to cleanse them of old emotions, thought patterns and stagnant energies. After the cleansing, we bring in a blessing for the hearth and home that is in harmony with the residents.

### Sweat Lodge Ceremonies

The Sweat Lodge ceremony has been performed by indigenous peoples around the world from ancient times up to the present and is a simple and powerful antidote to the mind maze of our modern Western culture. It purifies, restores and opens to our heart bonding with life, to experience our lives as a gift and a blessing. The ceremony clarifies our path in life and strengthens us to take the steps we need to celebrate our lives and bring them into balance.

We also advise communities interested in building their own Sweat Lodge.
