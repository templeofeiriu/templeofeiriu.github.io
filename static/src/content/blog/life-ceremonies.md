Baby Naming Ceremony
--------------------

Here the child is welcomed into life by the family and community. The child is blessed into the elements of fire, earth, water, air and ether to help to anchor them in this life and to bring protection and blessing. It is encouraged that the community bring their best intentions for the child, that will help them grow in strength and love.

Home Cleansing & Blessing
-------------------------

This service is offered so that your home can truly become a place of sanctuary, where you can rest and rejuvenate. We can clean our houses physically, but there is also the need to cleanse them of old emotions, thought patterns and stagnant energies. After the cleansing, we bring in a blessing for the hearth and home that is in harmony with the residents. [Please contact us for more information](https://templeofeiriu.github.io/)
