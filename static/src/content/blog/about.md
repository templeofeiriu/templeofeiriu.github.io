Upholding the Ancient Spiritual Traditions of Ireland





The Temple of Éiriú is recognised by the Irish State as a spiritual community. It is the Irish branch of an international collective that honours the old indigenous ways of the Earth and seeks to bring that wisdom forward to help us to navigate in these modern times. Its foundation is a blend of the old Celtic ways and the medicine path of the First Peoples of the Americas.

We hold a vision that all the peoples of the Earth will come together in this time, each with their own unique understandings, to create a healthy and sustainable way forward for ourselves, our children and the Earth herself.

We respect and support all traditions that hold the intention that all life is sacred.

​

The intent and vision of the Temple of Éiriú is;

*   To reclaim the Ancient lineage of the God and Goddess on the Land for the peoples.
    
*   To enable the restoration of the Sacred relationship between the people and the Land.
    
*   To recognise, hold and guard all life as Sacred on the Land.
    
*   To protect the sanctity of the children.
    
*   To hold and promote the equality of all peoples on the Land and respect all spiritual traditions on the Land.
    
*   To provide such spiritual, educational and public activities to provide for the spiritual welfare of members and the peoples.

Our Core Beliefs

​

The Creative Force, which can be called by many names, embodies female and male and is beyond both, is manifest and unmanifest, the immanent essence of all life, embraces Earth and Sky, and is the all and the everything.

All life is sacred, interconnected and interdependent within the web of existence.  
Grandmother Earth and her worlds (mineral, plant, animal, human and ancestral) are sacred, equal, and treasured jewels.

The Temple holds as sacred that nothing shall be done to harm any child of any world of Grandmother Earth, all life is born of woman, and within the interconnected web love is the only reality.

Female and male and all members of every race are fundamentally equal, such equality being evident and embodied in our actions.

The soul is eternal, ever learning and expanding; each of us choose, manifest and navigate our own destiny.

The primary alignment of the Temple is to the Goddess Brigid and the Ancient Holy Ones of Éire. We equally embrace the wisdom of teachers/prophets including Christ, Mother Mary, the Buddha, Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi (Amma) and other such teachers whose teachings are supportive of/congruent with our own belief system.

The Temple respects the presence of all other religious/spiritual traditions on the island of Éire and their right to their own unique beliefs.

### Fire Festivals

Fire is what holds people together in community and heart. Fire is a place to come together for warmth and connection, not only the physical level, but also emotionally, mentally and spiritually. We gather in community around the sacred fire, and as we hold our intentions for ourselves and others, we can find our stresses and difficulties transformed.

### Home Cleansing & Blessing

This service is offered so that your home can truly become a place of sanctuary, where you can rest and rejuvenate. We can clean our houses physically, but there is also the need to cleanse them of old emotions, thought patterns and stagnant energies. After the cleansing, we bring in a blessing for the hearth and home that is in harmony with the residents.

### Sweat Lodge Ceremonies

The Sweat Lodge ceremony has been performed by indigenous peoples around the world from ancient times up to the present and is a simple and powerful antidote to the mind maze of our modern Western culture. It purifies, restores and opens to our heart bonding with life, to experience our lives as a gift and a blessing. The ceremony clarifies our path in life and strengthens us to take the steps we need to celebrate our lives and bring them into balance.

We also advise communities interested in building their own Sweat Lodge.
