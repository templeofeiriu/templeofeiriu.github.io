About the event
---------------

We will dance outdoors for the day, our moving prayer circle centred around a sacred oak tree. Participants can dance the prayers of their own heart, for Éiriú, and beyond. **No previous experience is necessary, but some advance preparation is required so booking is essential**.

We dance to celebrate the places of balance in our lives as we remember the balancing energies of this time of the year. Facing into the darker days of winter, we come to release the old in beauty, to step into the new. From the bounty of this year, we gather the future seeds to dream with in the days ahead and as we dance, we remember that we are dancing our way in grace, peace, beauty, heart and freedom. From these virtues we draw the future to us, our prayers and intentions answered.
