We come together at this Autumn Equinox window, the time when light and dark are in perfect balance, to dance our prayers and our hearts dreaming into the Great Mystery of Life. Welcoming all who feel called to dance and connect to Grandmother Earth, to bless and feel her soft grass beneath bare feet, to participate in this ceremony that is both ancient and new, as the wheel of the year turns and we feel the rising energy of the Age of Aquarius.

We open to the healing medicine of Swan during this ceremony, the holder of soverignity and ancestral memory in our mythos.

This outdoor ceremony begins with us greeting and experiencing the blessings of the first rays of Grandfather Sun, rising over the Wicklow mountains. The axis mundi of our dance is a sacred oak, around which we dance our prayers awake. Each dancer is invited to dance the prayers of their hearts for Éiriú and beyond.

​

_**Saturday 21st and Sunday 22nd September 2024**_:

_**2 Day Shamanic Ceremonial Dance**_ to reconnect with the enlightened energy of the Swan, the holder of sovereignty and ancestral memory in our mythos.

We will dance outdoors for the day, our moving prayer circle centred around a sacred oak tree. Participants can dance the prayers of their own heart, for Éiriú, and beyond.

No previous experience is necessary, but some advance preparation is required so _**booking is essential.**_
