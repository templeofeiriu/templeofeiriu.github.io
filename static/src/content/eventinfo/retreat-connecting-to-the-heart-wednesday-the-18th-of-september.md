**About the facilitators**

_**Trish Cameron**_ works as a spiritual life coach and celebrant. She has trained for many years in indigenous spiritual traditions. These lineages understand that we are all interdependent and that love and oneness is at the core. Once we find that love and connection within, we can be at peace with ourselves, offering our unique gift to life. Trish is expert at compassionately guiding people into this sacred space within themselves.

_**TJ Maher**_ is an artist, author and gardener, having built a reputation for his talent in these creative pursuits..  TJ is represented by the Taylor Galleries and his work is contained in many private and public collections. As a gardener TJ has created the award winning Patthana Garden, this sanctuary reflects TJs’ deep spiritual connection to nature.  In 2024, his first book 'Grounded in the Garden' was released to critical acclaim.
