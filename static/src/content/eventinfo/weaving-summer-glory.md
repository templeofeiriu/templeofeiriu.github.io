Please note; 25th June, We are now at capacity, thank you for your interest in this event.

We invite you to join us at  An Nead in West Wicklow, the site of the Aisling Eala dance, to join with us again in drumming to the land in the morning, coming together in community. Weaving together the beauty and wisdom of the Trees in their full Summer Glory we will drum, chant and dance in celebration with our wise friends before going deep into the earth, crawling into the sweat lodge in the afternoon.

The intent of this day is to continue our work of creating a space to remember ourselves, our light and our connections, transmuting all that doesn't serve us and to bring all that we are learning through these evolving times of growth and emergence.

To take the time to gather our blessings, individually and collectively, and to anchor them for ourselves and all our relations.

Contribution requested is 60e, however no one is refused due to finances. If you require a concession please let me know.

_Hilary Healy EarthDragún lives in West Wicklow, where she tends her land including the young forest, which delights her heart. She has worked and trained with a few different traditions over the past 30 years and acknowledged as a Grandmother Elder, always with the intent to remember ourselves and our own traditions on this land of Éiriú._

_Karen Minchin OakHeartSinger,' I am a mother, Bean Feasa, and Song Carrier weaving together chants from the indigenous traditions I walk with. I have worked within community medicine circles for many years, and found home in the Temple of Éiriú, as lead ceremonial drummer for the Aisling Eala. Sitting with the sacred drum, allowing for the re-emergence of the ancient connection to the heartbeat of the land'._
