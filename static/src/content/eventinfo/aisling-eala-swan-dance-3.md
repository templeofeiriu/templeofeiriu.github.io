_**Invitation to Shamanic Dance Ceremony- in person**_

Saturday 23rd of Sept: Day shamanic ceremonial dance to reconnect with the enlightened energy of the Swan, the holder of sovereignty and ancestral memory in our mythos. We come together, at this time of the Autumn Equinox, this time of balance to dance our prayers and our hearts dreaming into the great mystery of life.

_"Sacred and Holy Ones we come at this time of the Autumn Equinox with gratitude in our hearts for the bounty of the harvest, dancing in beauty and grace with all that is sacred to us  in remembrance of the great Web of Life. Within this circle of trees, dancing to you Great Oak, we send our roots deep into the earth, reaching out to the heavens, becoming blessing prayers across the land and reweaving  our connections to the Great Web. With every beat of the drum, we step gracefully into our sovereignty, listening to our heartsongs , dancing  the blessings of Swan."_

We will dance outdoors for the day, our moving prayer circle centred around a sacred oak tree. Participants can dance the prayers of their own heart, for Éiriú, and beyond.

**No previous experience is necessary, but some advance preparation is required so booking is essential**.

Please note there is also an option to attend a Friday 22nd **community day to set up the Dance site and to  Drum, Chant and be in Sweat Lodge.** First option for this will go to Dance participants but contact us if it is of interest to you without attending Saturday 23rd
