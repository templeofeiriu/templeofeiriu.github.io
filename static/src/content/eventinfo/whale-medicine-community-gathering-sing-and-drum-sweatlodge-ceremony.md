About the event
---------------

**Community Gathering, Song and Drum and Sweat Lodge Ceremony**

**Sunday 8th September** - Sacred Song and drum circle (Facilitated by Helen Cantrell(RainbowStarlight) and Sweat lodge ceremony (facilitated by Hilary Healy (Dragún) in Talbotstown, Kiltegan (near Baltinglass, Co. Wicklow).

I am delighted that Hilary is on board to facilitate this day of absolute beauty for us all. Even if you haven't attended anything or tuned into the whale journeys you are super welcome to come along and part take.

In the morning time we will gather in Hilarys, Temple 'an Néad' and be with the drum and the chants and crystals to help us gather all the dreaming and everything that has come from these ceremonies over the last few months.

In the afternoon we will enter the Sweat lodge to anchor and embody the blessings from them.

Energy exchange 75euro.
