This circle of women is a sanctuary, a space of nourishment and replenishment, the opportunity to reclaim your authenticity. Our time together is an ongoing ceremony to unite heaven and earth within yourself. We will use talking circles, fire ceremony, visiting sacred sites on the land, movement, questing allies, vision quest and initiations as vehicles to bring ourselves into wholeness.

For further details and bookings contact Sylvia Roche 0863870578 sylviaroche@yahoo.com

This is an invitation to share in the 2021/22 cycle of the Everyday Goddess: a Ceremonial journey of Heart and Woman. We journey into Divine Feminine Sexual Energy; travelling from the Autumn Equinox through the dark of the year to its new beginnings and the rebirth of our creative energies at Bealtaine. This circle of women is a sanctuary, a space of nourishment and replenishment, the opportunity to reclaim your authenticity.

Trish Cameron (Star) is a medicine woman with over thirty year’s experience within the indigenous traditions of Eiriú (Ireland). Her passion is the reawakening of the ancient wisdom and spirit within the land and the people, with particular focus on the Divine Feminine Energies. She combines this with her earlier training in sexuality for women and offers you this course as a crystallization of her work so far.
