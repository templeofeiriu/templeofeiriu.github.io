25 Nov 2023, 10:00 – 17:30

The intent of this day is to continue our work of remembering ourselves, our light and our connections, and to bring all that we have learned in this past year into our winter season. To take the time to gather our blessings, individually and collectively, and to anchor them for ourselves and all our relations.

Hilary Healy EarthDragún lives in West Wicklow, where she tends her land including the young forest, which delights her heart. She has worked and trained with a few different traditions over the past 30 years and acknowledged as a Grandmother Elder, always with the intent to remember ourselves and our own traditions on this land of Éiriú.

Karen Minchin OakHeartSinger, I am a mother, Bean Feasa, and Song Carrier weaving together chants from the indigenous traditions I walk with. I have worked within community medicine circles for many years, and found home in the Temple of Éiriú, as lead ceremonial drummer for the Aisling Eala. Sitting with the sacred drum, allowing for the re-emergence of the ancient connection to the heartbeat of the land.
