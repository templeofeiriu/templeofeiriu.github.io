_**Invitation to Shamanic Dance Ceremony- in person**_

Sunday 19th: Day shamanic ceremonial dance to reconnect with the enlightened energy of the Swan, the holder of sovereignty and ancestral memory in our mythos. We come together, at this time of the Spring Equinox, this time of balance to dance our prayers and our hearts dreaming into the great mystery of life.

_‘Sacred and Holy Ones, we come in gratitude this day to dance. At this time of balance of day and night, we come to remember balance within, to remember the seeds that were planted in the deep darkness and rest of winter, and to step forward now to nurture this new growth to fruition for ourselves and all our relations. This day, we dance awakening the threads of Grace, Peace, Beauty, Heart and Freedom and offer them into the holding of the heart of the swan for all the children. May we awaken these virtues within ourselves and anchor them in our lives. May we be the change we wish to see, embodying our heart song with every beat of the drum’_

We will dance outdoors for the day, our moving prayer circle centred around a sacred oak tree. Participants can dance the prayers of their own heart, for Éiriú, and beyond.

**No previous experience is necessary, but some advance preparation is required so booking is essential**.

Please note there is also an option to attend a **Saturday 18th community day to set up the Dance site and to  Drum, Chant and be in Sweat Lodge.** First option for this will go to Dance participants but contact us if it is of interest to you without attending Sunday 19th
