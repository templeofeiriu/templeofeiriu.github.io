Through guided mediations, elemental ceremonies and connecting to nature we explore how to embrace change in our lives.  When we release old patterns, old ways of being and thinking we allow ourselves the freedom to greet the future with openness, confidence and the space for new beginnings.  This is an exclusive opportunity in the beautiful Patthana Garden to embark on a journey to nurture your body, heart and soul.  This day will help you find peace in your heart, go with the flow of life and then return home with a renewed sense of well-being. Price €130 includes tea & scones on arrival, home-cooked vegetarian lunch (organic and local where possible) plus afternoon tea & cake.  Places are strictly limited.

**About the facilitators**

_**Trish Cameron**_ works as a spiritual life coach and celebrant. She has trained for many years in indigenous spiritual traditions. These lineages understand that we are all interdependent and that love and oneness is at the core. Once we find that love and connection within, we can be at peace with ourselves, offering our unique gift to life. Trish is expert at compassionately guiding people into this sacred space within themselves.

_**TJ Maher**_ is an artist, author and gardener, having built a reputation for his talent in these creative pursuits..  TJ is represented by the Taylor Galleries and his work is contained in many private and public collections. As a gardener TJ has created the award winning Patthana Garden, this sanctuary reflects TJs’ deep spiritual connection to nature.  In 2024, his first book 'Grounded in the Garden' was released to critical acclaim.
