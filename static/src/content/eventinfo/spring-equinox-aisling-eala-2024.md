**Aisling Eala**

**Temple of Éiriú SWAN DANCE CEREMONY**

**Starting Sunday, March 17th: at An Nead, Kiltegan, Wicklow.**

_Centering - Checking in - Opening Prayers -  Intent Setting_

**Monday 18th March: Aisling Eala Swan Dance Ceremony**

_**Invitation to Spring Equinox Shamanic Dance Ceremony**_

We come together at this time of perfect balance to dance our prayers and our heart’s dreaming into the Great Mystery of life.

_**We dance for the children of all the worlds of Grandmother Earth, each of our footsteps honouring those who have gone before us as we dance on this Emerald land. We come to dance for Freedom, holding for all to live with Grace and Peace, with Beauty and Heart.**_

_**With every beat of the drum, gracefully stepping into our sovereignty, listening to our heartsongs as we dance the blessings of Swan.**_

_**Dancing to you Great Oak, within a circle of sacred trees, sending blessings to the ancient oak forests that once graced our lands, and celebrating each new forest that comes to replace them. May you grow strongly this summer, may we be nourished by the  medicine you hold for our soul as a people.**_

We will spend Sunday deepening into ceremonial space, preparing for  the Dance, cleansing our bodies and minds in preparation  as we listen to the wisdom of our Souls/Higher Selves in a Sweat Lodge Ceremony, rising before dawn on Monday 18th to greet the Sun, before we enter the Dance Arbour where we shall dance for as long as our energy lasts, our moving prayer circle centered around a Sacred Oak Tree. Participants are invited to dance the prayers of their own hearts, for Éiriú, and beyond during the ceremony.

**No previous experience is necessary, however some advance preparation is required.  Booking is essential**.

**Dance Chiefs**: Elder Grandmothers Trish Cameron & Hilary Healy

**Venue**: Kiltegan, West Wicklow, Ireland

**Suggested Donation**: €70, Concessions Available.
