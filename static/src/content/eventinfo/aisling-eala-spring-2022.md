'The days of sorrow are ended, The exile is over, The children return in all their beauty Out of the deep dark days of forgetting, They encircle me with their wings And my heart is full of hope'

As the Wheel of the Year turns, we invite you to the Spring Equinox Aisling Eala.

This is a one-day shamanic ceremonial dance to reconnect with the enlightened energy of the Swan, the holder of sovereignty and ancestral memory in our mythos. We come together, at this time of the Spring Equinox, this time of balance, of day and night, light and dark, to dance in celebration of all that we are, all that we hold in love, with all of our dreams, with all of our allies, holding steady in ourselves and connecting with others who hold the web for GrandMother Earth.

We dance, calling to all the sacred places that we know and love to come and be blessed in this dance. Sending a strong call to the sacred humans- seeing ourselves as guardians and protectors of our homes, our kith and kin, of this land that we love, dancing that we on this land of Éiriú may hold steady in these turbulent times.   We dance, remembering our ancestors and those of the future, seeing that weaving together of the peoples and the strength that comes from all of those who call Éiriú home.

We invite you to join us as we weave this intent step by step into the land, dancing for ourselves, our families and communities and for the generations to come.

We will dance outdoors for the day, our moving prayer circle centered around a sacred oak tree. Participants can dance the prayers of their own heart, for Éiriú, and beyond.

No previous experience is necessary, but some advance preparation is required so booking is essential.

Children and family are welcome to visit and participate for a time during the ceremony, with advance notice.
