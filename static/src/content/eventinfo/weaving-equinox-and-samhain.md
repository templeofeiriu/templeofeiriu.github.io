We invite you to join us at An Nead in west Wicklow, in the after glow of the Autumnal Aisling Eala Dance for a day of Drumming, chanting to the land in the morning and sweatlodge in the afternoon.

Weaving together at this time of Autumn Equinox and Samhain, as we sing in celebration with our Ancestors, before returning to the womb of the mother as we crawl into sweat lodge.

The intent of this day is to continue our work of creating a space to remember ourselves, our light and all our connections, transmuting all that doesnt serve us, and bring this heart lead wisdom through these evolving times of growth and emergence.

To take time to gather our blessings, individually and collectively, and to anchor them for ourselves , our communities and all our relations.

Contribution requested is 60euro, however no one is refused due to finances, If you require a consession please let me know.
