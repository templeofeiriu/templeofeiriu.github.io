About the event
---------------

As we usher in the season of Bealtaine, a time of fertility, growth, and new beginnings, we come together again to welcome back the flowering time for our 5th and final of this series, of **Drum, Chant and Sweat on the Saturday 6th of May, in the pristine lands of the Temple of Eiriu, at  An Nead, outside of Baltinglass, Co. Wicklow.**

We will begin in the morning with the drum, singing chants from different lands and this land, opening our hearts towards hope and awakening ourselves to celebrate who we are, as we are. As we step into the fiery radiance of summer, and into the afternoons sweat lodge, we will link in with Uisneach, the Cat Stone being the Axis Mundi of this land, the goddess Eiriu, and to the god Lugh, who are both associated deeply with Uisneach, to bring balance to the sacred feminine, and sacred masculine within, at this time of sacred union. Cost: The Cost for the day is 75Euro. Please get in touch if you would like to join us.
