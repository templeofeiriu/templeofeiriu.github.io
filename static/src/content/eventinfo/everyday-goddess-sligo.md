description: An in person training and mentorship supporting the rising feminine in returning to the sacred power of her sexuality.

---

This is an invitation to the upcoming cycle of women’s sacred sexuality. We dive deep in the journey into the divine feminine energy; travelling from the Spring Equinox, the waking up of springtime and our inner fire until Bealtaine time and the rebirth of our sexual energies. You are invited to partake in the return of the Divine Feminine, the mysteries she unfolds within you, the adventures she challenges you to embark upon and the freedom that she offers.

The focus of the course is for creative communication between the sexual and the spiritual within ourselves; to reclaim power, sovereignty and compassion so as to move through our lives comfortable in our own skins. This is done through sharing circles, shamanic journeys through meditations and visualisations, dance and movement, vision quests, and personal ceremonies, while connecting to the land and sacred sites in North West.

Trish Cameron (Star) is a medicine woman with over thirty years of experience within the indigenous traditions of Eiriu (Ireland). Her passion has been the reawakening of the ancient wisdom and spirit within the land & the people, with particular focus on the Divine Feminine energies. She combines this with her training in sexuality for women and offers you this course as a crystallization of her life’s work so far.
