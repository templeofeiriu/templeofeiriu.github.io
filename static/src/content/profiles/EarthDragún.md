EarthDragún lives in West Wicklow, where she tends her land including the young forest, which delights her heart. She has worked and trained with a few different traditions over the past 30 years and is acknowledged as a Grandmother Elder, always with the intent to remember ourselves and our own traditions on this land of Éiriú.
