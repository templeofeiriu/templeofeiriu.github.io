The Gold and Silver Trees of Life are the first Irish and Celtic gold and silver bullion medals or coins which are 99.99% pure and celebrate Irish and Celtic culture, our ancestors and our spirit.
‍
The Gold and Silver Trees of Life were created by Tara Coins to tell the story of Ireland or Éire through the sacred symbols of Ireland and the Celtic world.
These beautiful medals or non legal tender coins channel our ancestral past, our culture and the spirit of the Celts and the Irish people globally.

Irish heart and soul went into their creation by a team of Irish people including our founder, a graphic designer, an artist and cultural and spiritual mentors.

"The Trees" celebrate our ancestors, who we are as a people and the abundance of trees and nature.

These precious and timeless bullion & collector medals or coins are beautiful stores of value. They are limited in mintage and supply, making them highly sought after as collectibles and will likely command collectible prices in the coming years.
‍
Our vision is to see Tara Coins becoming an ethical, trusted global brand celebrated for the designing, minting and provision of beautiful gold and silver medals and coins for people throughout the world.
