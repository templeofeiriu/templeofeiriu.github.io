OakHeartSinger is a mother, Bean Feasa, and Song Carrier weaving together chants from the indigenous traditions she walks with. She has worked within community medicine circles for many years and found home in the Temple of Éiriú, as lead ceremonial drummer for the Aisling Eala. Sitting with the sacred drum, she allows for the re-emergence of the ancient connection to the heartbeat of the land.
